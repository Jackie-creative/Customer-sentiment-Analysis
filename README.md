# Customer-sentiment-Analysis
Customer sentiment analysis is the process of using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer feedback—such as reviews, support tickets, or survey responses—and determine whether the sentiment behind the text is positive, negative, or neutral.  
# 🗣️ Customer Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews to understand overall sentiment and identify common themes in feedback. Using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP), I performed text cleaning, sentiment scoring, and data visualization to provide actionable insights for product and service improvement.

## 🎯 Objective

- Classify customer reviews into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** categories.
- Identify **frequent keywords** and **pain points** mentioned in negative feedback.
- Visualize overall customer sentiment trends using charts and word clouds.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, TextBlob, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- WordCloud library

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Dataset used: [insert source or describe dataset — e.g., Amazon product reviews or Kaggle dataset]

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Removed punctuation, stopwords, and converted all text to lowercase  
   - Tokenized and lemmatized the reviews

3. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Used TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity and subjectivity  
   - Categorized reviews based on polarity:
     - Positive (> 0)
     - Neutral (0)
     - Negative (< 0)

4. **Visualization**  
   - Pie chart showing sentiment distribution  
   - Word clouds for positive and negative reviews  
   - Bar plot for top negative keywords

## 📊 Key Insights

- 65% of reviews were **positive**, 20% **neutral**, and 15% **negative**
- Most common negative words: *"late"*, *"broken"*, *"support"*, *"refund"*
- Customers appreciated fast delivery and product quality when giving positive reviews

## 📁 Project Files

- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full code and output
- `data/` – Folder with raw and cleaned datasets
- `images/` – Saved visualizations (word clouds, charts)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Hands-on experience with text preprocessing techniques and NLP libraries  
- Improved understanding of how to extract insights from unstructured text  
- Learned how to communicate data findings through visualization

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Apply advanced NLP methods like VADER or fine-tune sentiment thresholds  
- Train a supervised machine learning model to classify reviews  
- Automate sentiment reports for business use
